## Main info about Webpack configs options

- <strong>imagemin:</strong> Works with png, jpeg, jpg, gif, svg files without loss of quality
- <strong>entries:</strong> All entries should be placed in "front/js/pages" with name: <strong>[page-name].js</strong>, and the urls to this files should be placed in <strong>entries.config.js</strong> (watch this files for getting example)
- <strong>import SCSS:</strong> You should import SCSS-files to main pages .js files. Use <strong>import: '../some-url'</strong>

- <strong>Non processed files:</strong> Files like robots.txt should be placed in app/static. Webpack will copy that files to dist/

### Configs

We have 3 webpack configs wich use different features and level of code optimization:

- <strong>webpack.common.js:</strong> In this file you can find common webpack options, wich are used in both (dev and prod) modes.
* <strong>webpack.dev.js:</strong> This is simple configuration for dev mode, wich used webpack-dev-server with hot replacement and without compressing and difficult processing. Merged with webpack.common.js
* <strong>webpack.prod.js:</strong> This is hard configuration for production with JS, CSS, HTML and assets optimization.

### Main tasks:
* <strong>npm run dev:</strong> Use for starting developing mode. Default browser with project will open automaticly. If you have a local internet, you'll be able to open the site on mobile. For that, look at the adress in terminal.
* <strong>npm run build:</strong> Use for getting complete optimized project.
* <strong>npm run deploy:</strong> Project deployment on GitHub pages.
